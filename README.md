### Configure Switching irl
I delved into configuring switching elements like VLANs and trunks on Cisco Layer 2 Switches. Our objectives were to understand Cisco Switches, configure VLANs, and verify Telnet connections. We first built and configured a small network using a Cisco Switch 2960 to ensure connectivity. Then, we moved on to creating and verifying VLANs in the network. Through this process, we learned about switch performance indicators, console connections, and the use of PuTTY for remote access. Additionally, we configured IP addresses on switches, enabled Telnet connections, and assigned VLANs to specific ports.

## Lab 6
### Inter VLAN Routing 
We learned about different methods of inter-VLAN communication, such as traditional methods, router on a stick, layer 3 switch, and switch virtual interface (SVI). In Task 1, we configured Inter-VLAN Routing using Router on a Stick method. This involved creating VLANs, assigning switch ports, configuring trunk ports, assigning static IP addresses to laptops, and configuring inter-VLAN routing on the router. Through this process, we established communication between VLANs and tested connectivity successfully.

In Task 2, we configured Inter-VLAN Routing using a Layer 3 Switch. This included assigning IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways to hosts, creating VLANs, configuring SVI VLAN interfaces, configuring access ports, enabling IP routing, and testing inter-VLAN connectivity. We successfully established communication between VLANs using the Layer 3 Switch method.

In Task 3, we completed the topology setup by configuring four VLANs and checking connectivity between VLANs. This involved assigning IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways to PCs in different VLANs, configuring routers and switches accordingly, and testing connectivity. Overall, the lab provided hands-on experience in configuring Inter VLAN Routing using different methods, enhancing our understanding of network communication.

## Lab 7 
### Configuration of inter-VLAN on real-life Switches and Routers
My laptop (169.255.211.57) successfully pinged Shaheer's laptop (169.255.211.59) within VLAN 20. However, inter-routing was not implemented, causing ping attempts to fail when targeting devices in VLAN 10, as expected. We attempted inter-VLAN pinging from 169.255.211.57 to 169.254.211.59, highlighting the change in the second field of the IP address, indicative of the Class B network structure. VLAN 10 operates within XXX.254.XXX.XXX, while VLAN 20 operates within XXX.255.XXX.XXX. We also shared pictures of us working in the lab, showcasing our engagement and collaboration during the session within the manual

### Configuring General-purpose Network-Utilities 
we configured general-purpose network utilities and delved into understanding NAT. Starting with the setup of an SMTP server, we assigned IP addresses, configured router interfaces, and enabled SMTP and POP3 services, facilitating email communication between PCs. Subsequently, we configured an FTP server by assigning IPs, enabling FTP services, and adding user accounts, successfully transferring files between devices. Moving on, we set up HTTP and DNS servers, modifying HTML files and specifying domain names and IP addresses, allowing web access using domain names. Finally, we dynamically assigned IPs using the router's DHCP server, creating a pool, excluding certain addresses, and configuring PCs for dynamic IP allocation, ensuring proper network functionality.

## Lab 9
### Static and Dynamic Routing Protocols 
we explored static and dynamic routing protocols, aiming to configure them on routers for effective traffic management. Static routing involves manually adding routes to a router's table, suitable for smaller networks, while dynamic routing protocols like RIP automatically calculate the best path based on hop count. Task 1 focused on setting up static routes, interconnecting routers, assigning IP addresses, and configuring static routes via CLI commands. Task 2 extended this by configuring static routing on a different network topology, ensuring proper connectivity between routers and attached PCs. Task 3 introduced Routing Information Protocol (RIP), a distance vector protocol utilizing hop count for route selection. We configured RIP on routers, monitored its operation using commands like "show ip protocols" and "debug ip rip," and verified routing tables for successful configuration. Task 4 reiterated these concepts with a different network topology, emphasizing RIP routing configuration, and validating routing tables to ensure correct operation. Throughout the lab, adherence to specified configurations and thorough verification ensured a comprehensive understanding of routing protocols and their implementation.

## Lab10 
### Subnetting
we got into subnetting to design an IP Addressing Scheme and verify connectivity. Task 1 began with understanding subnetting by analyzing two device addresses and determining if they belong to the same or different subnets. Subsequently, subnetting a Class C network (204.15.5.0/24) was explored to accommodate the requirements outlined in Figure 3, ensuring the creation of five subnets. Task 2 focused on designing an IP addressing scheme for a network (172.31.1.0/24) depicted in the provided topology. Subnetting the network into seven subnets, each with 14 usable host addresses, required borrowing 4 bits for subnetting. Binary representations and subnet tables were created to assign subnets to LANs and WAN links, facilitating routing. The addressing scheme documented the assignment of subnet IP addresses and host addresses, ensuring proper connectivity. Configuration commands were provided for routers (R1, R2, R3, R4) to implement static or dynamic routing. Verification of connectivity involved pinging from designated devices to ensure communication across the network.

## Lab11
### Configuration of Standard, Extended Access Control List, NAT and PAT
The focus was on configuring and verifying Standard and Extended Access Control Lists (ACLs), as well as Network Address Translation (NAT) and Port Address Translation (PAT). Task 1 began with configuring a Standard ACL on Router 2 to restrict host PC1 from accessing the server while permitting all other hosts. The process involved defining ACL statements, applying them to the appropriate interface, and testing connectivity, followed by ACL removal and subsequent verification. Task 2 introduced Extended ACLs, offering greater precision by allowing filtering based on destination, protocol, or port. Configuration involved permitting access for PC1 while denying access for PC2, followed by verification using the "show access-lists" command on Router 2. Task 3 explored Static NAT and PAT configuration. PAT was configured on R1 for PC1 and PC2, while static NAT was set up on R2 for the server. The setup allowed mapping of private IP addresses to public ones, enabling network connectivity. Verification involved testing connectivity using ping commands and examining NAT translations and statistics. 

## Lab12
### Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Routing
The focus was on configuring and verifying Single and Multi-Area Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) Routing. Task 1 involved setting up a Single Area OSPF network, configuring OSPF routing processes on all routers, and verifying connectivity between PCs. Configuration steps included OSPF process creation, network advertisement, and manual specification of router IDs. Verification tasks encompassed pinging between PCs, running OSPF verification commands, and examining OSPF neighbor and interface information. Task 2 extended the lab to Multi-Area OSPF configuration. The topology consisted of two OSPF areas connected by an Area Border Router (ABR). Configuration steps mirrored Task 1 but included additional considerations for multi-area OSPF setup. Verification involved pinging between PCs, running OSPF verification commands, and analyzing OSPF neighbor and interface information. The lab submission adhered to the evaluation rubric, demonstrating proficiency in OSPF configuration, systematic data collection, and clear presentation of findings. Overall, the lab provided hands-on experience in implementing OSPF routing and understanding its features in both single and multi-area environments.
