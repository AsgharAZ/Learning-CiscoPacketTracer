## Learning-CiscoPacketTracer
 Documentation of me learning basic networking commands, deploying small networks using HUB & Bridge, network deployment with switches and IP transmission using DHCP, VLAN & Trunks configuration, inter-VLAN routing, general-purpose network utilities, routing protocols, subnetting, access control lists, NAT and PAT, and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing

## Lab 1
I learned basic networking commands for troubleshooting connectivity issues. The lab included tasks such as accessing network connection settings via `ncpa.cpl`, identifying connection types (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth), and understanding IPv4 and IPv6 statuses. I practiced using the command prompt for network configuration information and used the `ping` command to test connectivity and measure response times. I also used `tracert` to trace routes and identify potential network bottlenecks, understanding each step in data packet travel. The lab concluded with a troubleshooting scenario using traceroute to diagnose and resolve server connectivity issues.

## Lab 2
In this lab, I gained hands-on experience with setting up and troubleshooting a basic Local Area Network (LAN) using Packet Tracer. I started by familiarizing myself with Packet Tracer's interface, including its various menus and tools. Connecting devices like PCs and laptops to a hub in the simulation, exploring how to configure IP addresses and test network connections. I practiced assigning IP addresses to devices and ensuring they could communicate with each other. I also experimented with different connection types and observed how hubs and switches handle network traffic.
By creating and saving network topologies, I reinforced my understanding of network design and configuration. This lab helped me understand the practical aspects of networking, from setting up physical connections to using diagnostic tools to troubleshoot and ensure reliable communication between devices.

## Lab 3
I gained hands-on experience in setting up network infrastructure using switches and configuring a DHCP server to automatically assign IP addresses. I learned how switches manage traffic efficiently by forwarding packets only to the intended destination, reducing collisions. Additionally, I explored ARP tables to understand IP-MAC address mappings and utilized commands like ping to verify network connectivity.
